# RamenJourney Family Tree Implementation Status Report

## Implementation Status

### Completed Components
1. ✅ Created `InteractiveTreeWrapper.tsx` - A client-side wrapper for the D3.js visualization
2. ✅ Updated `TopPageInteractiveTree.tsx` with:
   - Browser environment detection
   - Improved simulation handling
   - Memory leak prevention
   - Enhanced accessibility features
   - Better error handling
3. ✅ Updated `TopPageTreeDemo.tsx` to use the new wrapper component
4. ✅ Created dedicated CSS modules for styling loading and error states
5. ✅ Created a test page at `/family-tree-test` for verification
6. ✅ Updated Next.js configuration to better handle client-side only libraries

### Current Status
- Development server is currently running
- The test page should be accessible at http://localhost:3000/family-tree-test
- We've simplified the Next.js configuration to avoid conflicts between settings

### Issues Addressed
1. 🛠️ Fixed SSR rendering issues with D3.js by using dynamic imports with `ssr: false`
2. 🛠️ Implemented proper cleanup of D3.js resources to prevent memory leaks
3. 🛠️ Added proper loading and error states with fallback UI
4. 🛠️ Enhanced accessibility with ARIA attributes
5. 🛠️ Added throttling for resize events to improve performance
6. 🛠️ Fixed Next.js configuration conflicts between various package handling options

## Next Steps
