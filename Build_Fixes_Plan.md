# Build Issues Analysis and Fix Plan

## Issues Identified

After analyzing your codebase, I've found two specific type errors preventing your build from completing:

### 1. Import Error with `sample-tree-data.ts`

```
Type error: Module '"@/components/toppage/sample-tree-data"' has no exported member 'sampleTreeData'. Did you mean to use 'import sampleTreeData from "@/components/toppage/sample-tree-data"' instead?
```

Your code in `/app/src/app/[locale]/interactive-tree-test/page.tsx` was previously using a named import for `sampleTreeData`, but the module exports it as a default export.

**Fix**: The line 8 in this file should use a default import like this:
```typescript
import sampleTreeData from '@/components/toppage/sample-tree-data';
```

This appears to be already fixed in your current code.

### 2. Missing Required Props for D3FallbackTest Component

```
Type error: Type '{}' is missing the following properties from type 'D3FallbackTestProps': data, viewMode, isPremiumUser, onNodeClick
```

The `D3FallbackTest` component requires four props that aren't being provided when it's rendered on line 279.

## Proposed Solution

Update the interactive-tree-test/page.tsx file to provide the required props to the D3FallbackTest component. Here's what needs to be changed:

```typescript
{activeView === 'fallback' && <D3FallbackTest />}
```

Should be changed to:

```typescript
{activeView === 'fallback' && (
  <D3FallbackTest
    data={sampleTreeData}
    viewMode={viewMode}
    isPremiumUser={isPremiumUser}
    onNodeClick={handleNodeClick}
  />
)}
```

This will provide all the required props to the component, making it consistent with how you're passing props to the InteractiveTreeWrapper component.

## Implementation Steps

1. Open the file at `app/src/app/[locale]/interactive-tree-test/page.tsx`
2. Find line 279 which currently reads: `{activeView === 'fallback' && <D3FallbackTest />}`
3. Replace it with the code shown above that includes all the required props
4. Save the file and rebuild the project

## Additional Recommendations

1. Consider adding prop type validation throughout your components with proper TypeScript interfaces or PropTypes
2. Add default values for non-essential props where appropriate
3. Implement error boundaries around visualization components to gracefully handle rendering failures
4. Add unit tests for the components to catch these issues earlier in the development cycle

After implementing these changes, your build process should complete successfully.
