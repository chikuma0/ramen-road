# Ramen Journey Implementation Plan

This document outlines the detailed implementation steps for building the new curated journeys feature.

## Technical Implementation

### 1. Database & Backend (2 weeks)

#### Week 1: Schema and API Development
- ✅ Create database schema for curated journeys (see `journey_curated_schema.sql`)
- ✅ Define type system with TypeScript interfaces (see `journey-extended.ts`)
- Set up API endpoints for:
  - Listing available journeys (free and premium)
  - Retrieving full journey details with episodes
  - Getting single episode with scenes
  - Tracking user progress
  - Managing premium access controls

#### Week 2: User Management & Premium Integration
- Implement subscription status check middleware
- Create admin CRUD operations for journey management
- Build progress tracking system for user journey advancement
- Set up knowledge card collection system
- Integrate with payment provider for premium upgrades

### 2. Frontend Components (3 weeks)

#### Week 1: Journey Discovery
- ✅ Create `CuratedJourneyCard` component for listings
- ✅ Build `CuratedJourneyDetails` page layout
- Implement journey filtering by type, audience, etc.
- Create homepage featured journey section

#### Week 2: Journey Consumption
- ✅ Develop `CuratedJourneyEpisodePage` component
- ✅ Build `PremiumLockedContent` paywall component
- Create scene navigation controls
- Implement progress indicators

#### Week 3: Interactive Elements
- Develop character profile modals
- Build knowledge card collection interface
- Create journey completion celebration screen
- Implement bookmarking system

### 3. Content Management (Ongoing)

- Create admin interface for journey creation
- Build rich text editor for episode content
- Implement media uploader for journey assets
- Create character management system
- Develop knowledge card creator

## Content Creation Pipeline

### 1. Research & Planning (1-2 weeks per journey)
- Choose journey theme and target audience
- Research historical facts and source material
- Draft journey outline with narrative structure
- Identify key characters and knowledge points
- Create detailed episode breakdown

### 2. Content Production (2-3 weeks per journey)
- Write episode text content
- Source or create imagery
- Record video interviews (if applicable)
- Design knowledge cards
- Create character profiles

### 3. Review & Optimization (1 week per journey)
- Editorial review of content accuracy
- UX review of journey flow and engagement
- Technical QA for performance and media loading
- Premium content allocation optimization

## Premium Strategy Implementation

### 1. Content Tiering
For each journey:
- Select 1-2 episodes as free preview (avoid narrative cliff-hangers)
- Make key character backstories premium exclusive
- Reserve most valuable knowledge cards for premium
- Create premium-exclusive "epilogue" content
- Add behind-the-scenes or expert commentary as premium

### 2. Subscription Features
- Implement three subscription tiers:
  - **Free**: Limited access to intro content
  - **Premium Basic** ($5.99/mo): Full access to all journeys
  - **Premium Plus** ($9.99/mo): Exclusive expert webinars and downloads

### 3. Conversion Optimization
- Create contextual upgrade prompts at strategic points
- Implement limited-time journey access promotions
- Build "save progress" triggers at premium boundaries
- Create journey completion certificates as shareable rewards

## Analytics Requirements

Implement tracking for:
- Journey start and completion rates
- Time spent per episode and total journey
- Knowledge card collection rate
- Premium conversion points
- Subscription retention correlated to journey engagement
- A/B testing of premium content boundaries

## Rollout Strategy

### Phase 1: Soft Launch (Month 1)
- Release with 2 complete journeys (1 beginner, 1 enthusiast level)
- Limited promotion to existing user base
- Gather feedback and usage data
- Optimize performance and fix issues

### Phase 2: Full Launch (Month 2)
- Add 3 additional journeys (varied types)
- Implement complete subscription system
- Begin marketing campaign
- Launch social sharing features

### Phase 3: Expansion (Month 3+)
- Regular release of new journeys (1-2 per month)
- Start user-generated content features
- Launch mobile app with offline journey access
- Expand to adjacent culinary domains

## Milestones & Success Metrics

### Launch Metrics
- 5 complete journeys available at launch
- 3 different journey types represented
- 90%+ technical performance score
- < 2-second page load time

### 30-Day Metrics
- 25% of active users start a journey
- 15% completion rate for started journeys
- 5% conversion rate to premium subscription
- 4.5+ average user satisfaction rating

### 90-Day Metrics
- 40% of active users engaged with journeys
- 10% premium subscription rate
- 8+ total journeys available
- 60% user retention for subscribers

## Resource Requirements

### Development Team
- 2 full-stack developers (8 weeks)
- 1 UI/UX designer (6 weeks)
- 1 QA engineer (4 weeks)

### Content Team
- 1 content strategist (ongoing)
- 2 writers (ongoing)
- 1 photographer/videographer (as needed)
- Domain experts for interviews (as needed)

### Operations
- Increased media storage capacity
- CDN setup for media delivery
- Regular database backups
- Analytics processing capacity

## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Low initial content volume | High | Medium | Pre-produce 5+ journeys before launch |
| Poor premium conversion | High | Medium | A/B test premium boundaries, adjust pricing |
| Content creation bottleneck | Medium | High | Develop template system and reusable components |
| Technical performance issues | Medium | Low | Implement lazy loading and CDN caching |
| User engagement drop-off | High | Medium | Add email re-engagement and progress reminders |

## Next Steps

1. Finalize database schema implementation
2. Complete frontend component development
3. Set up content creation tooling
4. Begin journey content production
5. Implement subscription payment processing
6. Set up analytics tracking 
7. Begin testing with focus group
